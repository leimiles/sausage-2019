## LuxLWRP__URP_7.1.5 unitypackage

This package contains the Lux LWRP HLSL shaders and custom shader graphs tweaked for Unity 2019.3.0b11 and URP 7.1.5. Importing it will overwrite the existing files for LWRP and should fix all shader errors.

Please note that Unity 2019.3 is still in preview just like the URP port of Lux LWRP Essentials.
